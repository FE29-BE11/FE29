            The rapid growth of technology has contributed to bringing
            futuristic items and lifestyles faster than ever. However, there is
            a massive gap between those who are ready to embrace the change and
            those who are not. In addition, technology meant to help humans has
            been misused by those to complicate and perpetuate conflicts. This
            is happening, among others, through cybercrimes, hate speeches,
            hoaxes, and discrimination on digital platforms.
